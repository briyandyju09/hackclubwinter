# Project Name

Smart Speaker with Alexa and Google Assistant

## Summary

Im going to build a smart speaker that runs linux, can be connected to a monitor to be used as a pc and runs both alexa and google assistant. 
This is going to be my first ever build and im going to make sure that i do my best.

## Plan

Im going to be using this guide by @DDelectrotech - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4HTAeJag with some changes and build the entire case from wood.
I will first build the case , then build the electronics , then setup the software and then add final touches like an led ring.
