# Project Name

RetroSwitch

## Summary

I want to build a handheld game console that looks like a nintendo switch. It can emulate and play any retro game and can be used also as a Linux computer.

## Plan

I will first assemble the case. Then set the screen to the PI. Then i will set the power source with a powerbank and setup all the tactile switches with the teensy.
